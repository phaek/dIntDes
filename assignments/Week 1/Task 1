Interaction Design 2017 – Mandatory Assignments
Task 1
You must include a description of
• Name of all group members
• Domain
• Target group
• Task you will focus on
• How you have secured access to target group and domain
• Brief motivation for choice
• Status of TA approval of your choice
Background
For the project you must choose a case to work with. It is important that you do this early on
in order to get a quick start. You should choose a project domain, which you know you can
get access to at least twice during the quarter period. First, in order to conduct empirical
studies and later for prototype evaluation.
For the project, you should decide on a specific target group, a task and a domain. (This
cannot be IT students and the university ;-). It might be children cooking in the kitchen,
elderly shopping at home, tourists finding their way arriving and seeking to find inspiration
for experiencing the city at the railway station etc. You should have your TA approve your
choice of subject and you should report your choice of project in a first mandatory
assignment. (This is the first mandatory assignment, and it is a pass, no-pass assignment ;-
).
