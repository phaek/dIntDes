Interaction Design 2017 – Mandatory Assignments
Task 2
Make your own Business card (visitkort) using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
Individual assigment
You shall make a website which is a digital representation of your business card.
It must include
- brief presentation of yourself
- some form of animation
- interactive element(s)
- background music or sound
It should be something serious, like something you would want your future employer
to look at. It can include humour, but non-serious solutions are not accepted.
Via blackboard you must upload a zip-file including your HTML, CSS and Javascript
resources. You must use a text-editor. You cannot use a “What You See is What You
Get” editor like e.g. Dreamweaver.
Together with your TA, you will nominate the best business card of your class, which will go
on to the final competition where the best business card of the year gets the prestiguous
Interaction Design 2017 Best Business Card Award.
